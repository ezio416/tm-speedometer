# Speedometer

This plugin brings a speedometer with the RPM gauge, a gear indicator, and the speed.

Different themes are included, and you can create your own! ([see here](src/Themes/README.md))

This plugin was created for the [Project Horizon](https://trackmania.exchange/s/tr/65123) - a map by MCYCShadow, that brings the Horizon speedometer!

Originally created by [Greep](https://openplanet.dev/u/89matt89), as of September 2025 this is now being maintained by [Ezio](https://openplanet.dev/u/ezio416).
